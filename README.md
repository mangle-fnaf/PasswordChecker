# PasswordChecker
An MVP for a password checker

The chosen formula:
Entropy=length×log2​(character set size)

This formula was chosen after extensive research into different entropy calculations and formulae. 
I concluded that this formula is the most appropriate for checking passwords as it calculates the maxmimum possible entropy for passwords (length and charset).
